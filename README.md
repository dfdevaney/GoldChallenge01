# GoldChallenge01
After the initial commit, I realized my layout for the projects was not set up well.
So I moved a bunch of the original files around. This may have upset a lot of the file locations.
Also, it's super frustrating to enter a bunch of code, only to have it not work correctly. 
I did not have enough time to properly debug the errors. On top of that, some of the work is incomplete; again, time was not helping.
The Dictonary does not work - I did not find a way to make it opperate correctly.
Looking back on it, the code seems very simple, but I remember being very stressed trying to come up with the proper proceedure for making the code.
